Check out the markdown file [`welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/swift-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md) to see how this exercise is injected into the template.

# Template Resources

[`markdowns/welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/swift-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md)  
What you are reading here is generated by this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](https://tech.io/doc/reference-markdowns) to render text, media and to inject programming exercises.


[`swift-project`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/swift-template/tree/master/swift-template)  
A simple Swift project (using Swift Package Manager + XCTest) dedicated to run the programming exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image. You can find images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or you can even [build your own](https://tech.io/doc/reference-runner).


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/swift-template/blob/master/techio.yml)  
This *mandatory* file describes both the table of content and the programming project(s). The file path should not be changed.


# Visual and Interactive Content

Tech.io provides all the tools to embed visual and interactive contents like a Web app or a Unix terminal. Please refer to the [documentation](https://tech.io/doc) to learn more about the viewer integrations.
